        <![CDATA[<p>Are Linux devs getting upset with the Python community? We weigh in on a nuanced issue. Plus the mass-mod resignation over at Rust, and Mike&#39;s thoughts on setting up a dev environment on Windows 11.</p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://dominickm.com/windows-11-a-devs-perspective/" title="Windows 11 - A Dev's Perspective" rel="nofollow">Windows 11 - A Dev's Perspective</a> &mdash; I was up and running with Python / FastAPI in less than a half hour. Postgresql, my database of choice, works just fine on Windows. Coder Radio listeners will know that I have been a fan of WSL for some time, however, for this challenge, I stuck with native Windows tooling. That’s right PowerShell! Upon install and launching the now built-in Windows Terminal, I was prompted to update PowerShell to PowerShell 7 and it’s great. If you only use BASH for basic terminal functionality or git from the CLI, you’ll be just fine on PowerShell.</li><li><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Python-stop-screwing-distros-over.html" title="Python: Please stop screwing over Linux distros" rel="nofollow">Python: Please stop screwing over Linux distros</a> &mdash; I manage my Python packages in the only way which I think is sane: installing them from my Linux distribution’s package manager. I maintain a few dozen Python packages for Alpine Linux myself. It’s from this perspective that, throughout all of this turmoil in Python’s packaging world, I have found myself feeling especially put out.
Every one of these package managers is designed for a reckless world in which programmers chuck packages wholesale into ~/.pip, set up virtualenvs and pin their dependencies to 10 versions and 6 vulnerabilities ago, and ship their computers directly into production in Docker containers which aim to do the minimum amount necessary to make their user’s private data as insecure as possible.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/671" title="mod team resignation by BurntSushi · Pull Request #671 · rust-lang/team" rel="nofollow">mod team resignation by BurntSushi · Pull Request #671 · rust-lang/team</a> &mdash; The entire moderation team resigns, effective immediately.

Upon install and launching the now built-in Windows Terminal, I was prompted to update PowerShell to PowerShell 7 and it’s great. If you only use BASH for basic terminal functionality or git from the CLI, you’ll be just fine on PowerShell.</li><li><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Python-stop-screwing-distros-over.html" title="Python: Please stop screwing over Linux distros" rel="nofollow">Python: Please stop screwing over Linux distros</a> &mdash; I manage my Python packages in the only way which I think is sane: installing them from my Linux distribution’s package manager.
