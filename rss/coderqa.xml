By leveraging AVX-512, they were able to achieve significant performance improvements — from three to 94 times faster — compared to standard implementations. AVX-512 enables processing large chunks of data in parallel using 512-bit registers, which can handle up to 16 single-precision FLOPS or 8 double-precision FLOPS in one operation.

        <![CDATA[<p>Big promises are being made in Ruby land, Tech Crunch says Open Source is dead, and we have thoughts to share about both!</p>

<p>We also discuss Google&#39;s Time Crystals. They have the power to fundamentally change our lives, but what the heck are they?</p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a title="Sorbet Compiler" rel="nofollow" href="https://sorbet.org/blog/2021/07/30/open-sourcing-sorbet-compiler">Sorbet Compiler</a> &mdash; For the past year, the Sorbet team has been working on an experimental, ahead-of-time compiler for Ruby, powered by Sorbet and LLVM. Today we’re sharing the source code for it.</li><li><a title="Patrick Collison on Twitter" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1410269843585069056">Patrick Collison on Twitter</a> &mdash; We're big believers in multi-year infrastructure bets. After a few years of Ruby infra work, our in-house Ruby compiler is now 22–170% faster than Ruby's default implementation for Stripe's production API traffic. If interested in working on such problems, we're hiring!</li><li><a title="Sorbet · A static type checker for Ruby" rel="nofollow" href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet · A static type checker for Ruby</a> &mdash; Sorbet is 100% compatible with Ruby. It type checks normal method definitions, and introduces backwards-compatible syntax for method signatures.</li><li><a title="Time crystals" rel="nofollow" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/google-may-have-achieved-breakthrough-time-crystals">Time crystals</a> &mdash; But time crystals want to be coherent. So putting them inside a quantum computer, and using them to conduct computer processes could potentially serve an incredibly important function: ensuring quantum coherence.</li><li><a title="White paper: Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor" rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13571">White paper: Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor</a> &mdash; Here we implement a continuous family of tunable CPHASE gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an eigenstate-ordered DTC. We demonstrate the characteristic spatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis.

We demonstrate the characteristic spatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum.
