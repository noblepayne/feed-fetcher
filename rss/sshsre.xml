This video shows how I use Ansible and Ansible Vault in conjunction with docker-compose to keep my secrets safe and encrypted whilst still being able to push my repos to Github publicly.</li><li><a title="KTZ Systems" rel="nofollow" href="https://ktzsystems.com/">KTZ Systems</a> &mdash; We specialize in professional cloud infrastructure management and business network services.</li><li><a title="Gitea 1.19.0 is released" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.gitea.io/2023/03/gitea-1.19.0-is-released/">Gitea 1.19.0 is released</a> &mdash; We are proud to present the release of Gitea version 1.19.0.</li><li><a title="Linode Green Light Beta Program" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linode.com/green-light/">Linode Green Light Beta Program</a> &mdash; Get early access and test new Linode products before they hit the market, provide valuable feedback to influence product direction, and become part of a community of developers helping us build the cloud that works for you.</li><li><a title="Docker is deleting Open Source organisations" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.alexellis.io/docker-is-deleting-open-source-images/">Docker is deleting Open Source organisations</a> &mdash; Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user who had created an "organisation", telling them their account will be deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team plan. The email contained a link to a tersely written PDF (since, silently edited) which was missing many important details which caused significant anxiety and additional work for open source maintainers.</li><li><a title="Alex Ellis&#39; Web Site" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.alexellis.io/">Alex Ellis&#39; Web Site</a></li><li><a title="Podman issue pulling from local registry" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/discussions/5946861">Podman issue pulling from local registry</a></li><li><a title="/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#etcsubuid-and-etcsubgid-configuration">/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration</a> &mdash; Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs listed in the files /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid.</li><li><a title="Using volumes with Podman" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#using-volumes">Using volumes with Podman</a> &mdash; If your container runs with the root user, then root in the container is actually your user on the host. UID/GID 1 is the first UID/GID specified in your user's mapping in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, etc. If you mount a directory from the host into a container as a rootless user, and create a file in that directory as root in the container, you'll see it's actually owned by your user on the host.</li><li><a title="Hub 4 pioneers ethical AI integration for a more productive and collaborative future" rel="nofollow" href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/hub-4-pioneers-ethical-ai-integration-for-a-more-productive-and-collaborative-future/">Hub 4 pioneers ethical AI integration for a more productive and collaborative future</a> &mdash; Today, we are excited to announce a major step forward with Hub 4 – the very first on-premises collaboration platform to integrate intelligent features across its applications.</li><li><a title="Remove not supported column comments for SQLite - Nextcloud" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36803">Remove not supported column comments for SQLite - Nextcloud</a> &mdash; Some times column comments are used, e.g. to make clear an integer is used as a timestamp.
For SQLite column comments are not supported and migration that use column comments will not work (see linked comment above for an example).
Somehow it works when you have a clean install, then all migrations pass, but when executing single migrations they will fail.</li><li><a title="Updating to 3.2.0 fails on SQLite installations · Nextcloud" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/issues/1549">Updating to 3.2.0 fails on SQLite installations · Nextcloud</a></li><li><a title="Command Line Shell For SQLite" rel="nofollow" href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html#recover">Command Line Shell For SQLite</a> &mdash; Like the ".dump" command, ".recover" attempts to convert the entire contents of a database file to text.</li><li><a title="Converting Nextcloud database typw" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_database/db_conversion.html">Converting Nextcloud database typw</a> &mdash; You can convert a SQLite database to a better performing MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL database with the Nextcloud command line tool. SQLite is good for testing and simple single-user Nextcloud servers, but it does not scale for multiple-user production servers.</li><li><a title="Belkin (Wemo) takes “big step back” from Matter" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/11t1jsc/belkin_wemo_takes_big_step_back_from_matter/">Belkin (Wemo) takes “big step back” from Matter</a> &mdash; Belkin says Wemo devices will support Matter once the company can "find a way to differentiate them,"</li><li><a title="Alby — Lightning for your Browser!" rel="nofollow" href="https://getalby.com/">Alby — Lightning for your Browser!</a> &mdash; Alby brings Boosts to the web.</li><li><a title="Self-Hosted on the Podcastindex.org" rel="nofollow" href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/830124">Self-Hosted on the Podcastindex.org</a> &mdash; Send a Boost into the show via the web.
